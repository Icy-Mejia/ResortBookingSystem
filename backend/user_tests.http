### Get All Users (Admin Only)
# This retrieves a list of all registered users in the system.
GET http://localhost:5000/api/admin/users
Authorization: Bearer {{adminToken}}

### Get User by ID (Admin Only)

GET http://localhost:5000/api/admin/users/1
Authorization: Bearer {{adminToken}}

### Update User Role (Admin Only)
# IMPORTANT:
# 1. Replace YOUR_USER_ID_TO_UPDATE_HERE with the ID of a user whose role you want to change (e.g., a guest user's ID).
# 2. Do NOT try to change the role of the admin account you are currently using, as there's a security check for that.
# 3. Valid roles: "guest", "admin", "customer service".
PUT http://localhost:5000/api/admin/users/1
Content-Type: application/json

### Delete User (Admin Only)
# IMPORTANT:
# 1. Replace YOUR_USER_ID_TO_DELETE_HERE with the ID of a user you want to delete.
# 2. NEVER delete the admin account you are currently using.
# 3. If a user has active bookings, the server might prevent deletion (due to foreign key constraints).
#    You might need to cancel or delete their bookings first from the database or via the booking endpoints.
